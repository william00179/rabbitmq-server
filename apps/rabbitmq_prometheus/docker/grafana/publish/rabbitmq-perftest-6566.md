## README

[PerfTest](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test) is a RabbitMQ performance testing tool. Verified to work with PerfTest v2.2.0 - v2.9.0.

Visualise the following metrics from all PerfTest instances:

* end-to-end message latency
* publish confirm latency
* messages published / s
* messages confirmed / s
* messages returned / s
* messages consumed / s
* messages rejected / s
